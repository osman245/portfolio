abstract: In this experiment we identify the lighting technologies being used in NYC using a Visible and Near Infrared hyperspectral (VNIR) imaging. The instrument is a scanning, single channel spectrograph that provides the spectral signatures in 872 different spectral channels between 0.4um and 1um. The spectra obtained from the instruments is then matched with those that have been tested in the laboratory by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
