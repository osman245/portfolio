## Python in Practice

- In the previous modules, we learnt about python's built-in 'simple' types. In this module, we will learn about the different ways in which the data of those types can be organized, so that it can be used (algorithmically) efficiently.
> we have already covered `str`, `int`, `float`, and `complex`. Here, we will also introduce the remaining two -- `bool` and `None` python's built-in types

- We will also take a look at how to reduce code duplication and improve code readability by using Functions.

- Finally we will look at Exception Handling in which we will learn about ways of making our code handle the errors without crashing.

## Data Structures
Python's most basic data structure is the `sequence`. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number known as index number. Different types of sequences in Python are:
- `List`
- `Tuple`
- `Range`
- Text sequence types e.g. `str`
- Binary sequence types e.g. `bytearray`, `buffer`

Python has several built-in data structures (or compound types) that act as containers and hold the other types. They are:
- List
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries
