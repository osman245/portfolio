## Intro to Pandas
**Pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.
Pandas provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. To get started with pandas, you will need to get comfortable with its two workhorse data structures: Series and DataFrame. 

We use `import pandas as pd` so that we wont have to type `pandas` everytime we want to use the module, instead we can use `pd`.

A gentle reminder to use tab-completion(`<TAB>`) and `?` to explore and access the documentation for anything that you are looking for.

Example:
```ipython
In [1]: pd.<TAB>
```
or 
```ipython
In [2]: pd.__version__?
```
